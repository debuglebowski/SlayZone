# General

- We need more emotional design.
  - More animations (WHICH MUST BE GRACEFUL)
  - Nail the first impression.
  - Add moments of delight
  - Make interactions feel dynamic.
- Remove the top window bar (containing the red, yellow, green buttons on mac). Embed the tree dots inside the window.
- Add fav-logo to application
- Make sure that we are able to build the application in preparation distribution.

  # Kanban screen

- Rename the project by clicking on the project name/title.
- Each renaming in the header should not display the text area visuals, it should just display a cursor.
- Solve better solution for the archived tasks. Make them as a switch instead - similar to blocked and done.
- I want some more tasteful and relevant data on the task cards.

# Task screen

- I want recurring tasks, that "resets" each x time. This should probably be in the setting sidebar.
- I want the header (Title, arrow, work mode button, etc) to be the same width as the content - centered at the middle.
- I then want the settings sidebar to be aligned with the right side of the window. This should be "separated" from the rest of the layout.
- I want the description field to be a normal shadcn text area. I e.g. don't want it to change in active mode.
- I want the title to always be a non-styled text input. This means that apart from the text style, there should be no other style. No border, outlines, etc.

# Workmode screen

- I want to be able to hide the sidebar, both with a button and a keyboard shortcut.
- I want another thing that I call a dumper. This is a thing where you just send in a bunch of unorganized thoughts - and the AI tries to make sense of it. It structrures everything in a way that is more readable for the human. It also comes up with gaps and questions about the content.
