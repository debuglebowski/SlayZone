# Workmode screen

- I want another thing that I call a dumper. This is a thing where you just send in a bunch of unorganized thoughts - and the AI tries to make sense of it. It structrures everything in a way that is more readable for the human. It also comes up with gaps and questions about the content.

# Improvements

- The Chat should be a fully-fledged chat.
- The organize-stuff should get more prompt-work.
- Shortcut settings
- Standardize shortcuts (esp for the work mode)
- Add versioning on all content
- Add mentions in the chat at least - the chat should be able to modify the content in the mentioned. It should also be able to open a browser.
- Add a way for the AI to "get started" with a task.
- Add a feedback element in each task to know which one is currently working via the the AI.
- Add a way to "instruct" the the AI to do work on a task. I'm not sure if this should be done via the Chat interface?
