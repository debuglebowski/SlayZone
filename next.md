# General

- We need more emotional design.
  - More animations (WHICH MUST BE GRACEFUL)
  - Nail the first impression.
  - Add moments of delight
  - Make interactions feel dynamic.
- Remove the top window bar (containing the red, yellow, green buttons on mac). Embed the tree dots inside the window.

  # Kanban screen

- Each renaming in the header should not display the text area visuals, it should just display a cursor.

# Task screen

- I want the title to always be a non-styled text input. This means that apart from the text style, there should be no other style. No border, outlines, etc.

# Workmode screen

- I want another thing that I call a dumper. This is a thing where you just send in a bunch of unorganized thoughts - and the AI tries to make sense of it. It structrures everything in a way that is more readable for the human. It also comes up with gaps and questions about the content.

# Improvements

- The Chat should be a fully-fledged chat.
- The organize-stuff should get more prompt-work.
