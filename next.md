- I want another thing that I call a dumper. This is a thing where you just send in a bunch of unorganized thoughts - and the AI tries to make sense of it. It structrures everything in a way that is more readable for the human. It also comes up with gaps and questions about the content.

# Improvements

- The Chat should be a fully-fledged chat.
- The organize-stuff should get more prompt-work.
