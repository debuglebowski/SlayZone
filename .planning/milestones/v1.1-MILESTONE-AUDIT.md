## Tech Debt

None accumulated during v1.1 development.

## Anti-Patterns

No TODOs, stubs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations found across any phase.

## Human Verification Recommended

Visual and interaction tests that require app execution:

1. **Theme toggle** — dark/light switch applies everywhere
2. **Theme persistence** — restarts without flash
3. **System theme following** — OS changes propagate
4. **Search modal** — Cmd/Ctrl+K opens, filtering works
5. **Task archive flow** — archive, view, unarchive
6. **Settings tabs** — navigation between General/Tags/About
7. **Subtask navigation** — click subtask opens detail
8. **Work mode empty state** — 3 buttons, no blank area
