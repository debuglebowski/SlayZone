# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-17
**Phases:** 1-7
**Total Plans:** 32

## Overview

Desktop task management app with kanban board, AI-powered Work Mode, and focused UX. Phases derived from requirement categories and dependencies. Foundation establishes secure Electron patterns, then data layer enables all features. Navigation/projects before task management (need project context). AI integration separate from Work Mode to isolate complexity. Polish last.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Secure Electron shell with IPC patterns and SQLite database initialized
**Depends on**: Nothing
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Scaffold Electron-Vite + Tailwind/shadcn
- [x] 01-02: Database layer with better-sqlite3
- [x] 01-03: Typed IPC API + security verification

**Details:**
- App launches and displays React UI in Electron window
- SQLite database created in userData directory with tasks, projects, workspace_items tables
- Preload script exposes typed IPC API (contextBridge)
- Security baseline: nodeIntegration false, contextIsolation true, sandbox true

**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Extend IPC layer (update/delete handlers)
- [x] 02-02: Install shadcn form components + Zod schemas
- [x] 02-03: Build CRUD UI (task list, dialogs)

**Details:**
- Task CRUD with title, description, status, priority, due date

---

### Phase 3: Navigation + Projects

**Goal**: Users can navigate between projects and configure the app
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Install shadcn components + react-colorful
- [x] 03-02: Add tags/settings tables + IPC handlers
- [x] 03-03: Build sidebar with project blobs + All view
- [x] 03-04: Build project dialogs + context menu
- [x] 03-05: Build user settings dialog

**Details:**
- Sidebar shows project blobs with 2-letter abbreviation and color
- "All" view across projects
- Right-click project for settings or delete
- Add/edit project via modal
- User settings for tags and database path

---

### Phase 4: Task Management

**Goal**: Full task management with kanban, filtering, organization, and detail view
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 7 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Install dnd-kit + extend API for subtasks/tags
- [x] 04-02: Build kanban board with drag-drop
- [x] 04-03: Build filter controls and persistence
- [x] 04-04: Integrate filters with kanban + card indicators
- [x] 04-05: Build task detail page with markdown
- [x] 04-06: Add subtasks feature
- [x] 04-07: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Kanban board with columns grouped by status (default), priority, or due date
- Drag-drop tasks between columns
- Filter by priority, due date range, tags, blocked, and done
- Filter state persists per project
- Task detail page with all fields editable inline
- Subtasks with independent status
- Markdown description (rendered view, click to edit)

### Phase 5: AI Integration

**Goal**: Claude CLI spawns from app with task context and streams responses
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Foundation: types + migration + spawner service
- [x] 05-02: IPC layer: handlers + preload + cleanup
- [x] 05-03: UI: hook + components + persistence
- [x] 05-04: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- AI chat in Work Mode with message sending
- Spawns Claude CLI with current task context
- Response streams character-by-character
- Cancel ongoing response
- Chat history persists in workspace

---

### Phase 6: Work Mode

**Goal**: Users can enter focused workspace with browser tabs and living documents
**Depends on**: Phase 4, Phase 5
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: IPC layer for workspace items CRUD
- [x] 06-02: Work Mode container + navigation + webview enablement
- [x] 06-03: Workspace sidebar + item management
- [x] 06-04: Browser view + document editor components
- [x] 06-05: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Enter Work Mode from task detail page
- Workspace sidebar shows items (chat, browser tabs, documents)
- Add browser tab by URL, loads in embedded view
- Create living document and edit markdown
- Rename or delete any workspace item

---

### Phase 7: Polish + UX

**Goal**: Power user features and first-run experience complete
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Add tags to CreateTaskDialog
- [x] 07-02: Keyboard shortcuts (n, esc)
- [x] 07-03: What Next prioritization
- [x] 07-04: First-launch onboarding
- [x] 07-05: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- "What Next" suggests highest-priority task based on due date, priority, blocked status
- Keyboard shortcut "n" opens new task modal from anywhere
- Keyboard shortcut "esc" closes modals or navigates back
- Add task modal with all fields (title, project, priority, due, tags, description)
- First launch onboarding flow

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Electron over Tauri (Node backend can spawn Claude CLI directly)
- App provides context to Claude (simpler than DB access)
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind (accessible, flexible)
- WAL mode for SQLite (concurrent performance)
- ViewState discriminated union (state-based routing)
- dnd-kit for drag-drop (best React DnD library)
- Single active Claude process (prevents resource exhaustion)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Tailwind v4 configuration differences from v3
- react-markdown v10 className API change
- react-hook-form type compatibility with Zod arrays
- useHotkeys form field interaction prevention

**Technical Debt:**

- TaskItem.tsx, TaskList.tsx — legacy components, unused (safe to delete)
- WorkspaceSidebar.tsx — created but WorkModePage uses inline sidebar instead
