## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Team/collaboration | Solo-focused app, Things 3 proves this works |
| Web app | Desktop-first, Electron only |
| Mobile companion | Defer to post-v1, focus on desktop experience |
| Complex recurring (RRULE) | Simple patterns only, edge cases multiply |
| Gantt charts/dependencies | Overengineering for personal tasks |
| Third-party integrations | Start with 0, add based on demand |
| Customizable statuses | Fixed workflow is simpler and opinionated |
| Gamification | Narrow appeal, focus on intrinsic motivation |
| Location-based reminders | GPS complexity not worth it |
