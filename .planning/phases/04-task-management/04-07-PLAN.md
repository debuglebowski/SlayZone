<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete task management system: kanban board, filtering, task detail page, subtasks</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Start app: npm run dev

    **1. Kanban Board (KANBAN-01, 02)**
    - [ ] Kanban shows 6 status columns
    - [ ] Tasks appear in correct column by status

    **2. Group By (KANBAN-03, 04)**
    - [ ] Switch to "Priority" grouping - 5 columns P1-P5
    - [ ] Switch to "Due Date" grouping - columns for Overdue/Today/Week/Later/None

    **3. Drag-Drop (KANBAN-05)**
    - [ ] Drag task from one column to another
    - [ ] Task status updates after drop
    - [ ] Refresh page - change persisted

    **4. Task Cards (KANBAN-06)**
    - [ ] In "All" view, cards show project color dot
    - [ ] Overdue tasks show red indicator
    - [ ] Blocked tasks show blocked indicator

    **5. Filtering (FILT-01 through 05)**
    - [ ] Filter by priority works (shows only P1, P2, etc.)
    - [ ] Filter by due date range works
    - [ ] Filter by tags works (if tags assigned)
    - [ ] "Show Blocked" toggle hides/shows blocked tasks
    - [ ] "Show Done" toggle hides/shows completed tasks

    **6. Filter Persistence (FILT-06)**
    - [ ] Set some filters
    - [ ] Switch to different project
    - [ ] Switch back - filters restored

    **7. Task Detail (DETAIL-01, 02)**
    - [ ] Click task card - opens detail page (no sidebar)
    - [ ] Back button returns to kanban
    - [ ] Can edit title inline (click, type, blur)
    - [ ] Can change status via dropdown
    - [ ] Can change priority via dropdown
    - [ ] Can set/change due date
    - [ ] Can add/remove tags

    **8. Markdown Description (DETAIL-03)**
    - [ ] Description renders as markdown (try **bold**, # heading)
    - [ ] Click description - switches to edit mode
    - [ ] Edit and blur - saves and renders

    **9. Subtasks (ORG-01, DETAIL-04)**
    - [ ] Subtasks accordion shows on detail page
    - [ ] Can add subtask (type and Enter)
    - [ ] Can toggle subtask done/not done
    - [ ] Can edit subtask title

    - [ ] Due dates show overdue indicator correctly
    - [ ] Tags can be assigned to tasks

    **Regression check:**
    - [ ] Sidebar navigation still works
    - [ ] Project CRUD still works
    - [ ] Task create/delete still works
